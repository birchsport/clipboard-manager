# Birchboard features

Birchboard is a native macOS clipboard history manager. It runs as a
background menu-bar agent and presents a floating panel with keyboard-first
navigation, searchable history, per-entry transforms and actions,
user-authored snippets, and syntax-highlighted previews of any code it
captures.

System requirements: macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer. Apple Silicon or Intel.

## Capture

- Text, RTF, images, and file references.
- Source app metadata: the app icon + name beside each entry.
- **Ignore list** (Settings → Privacy): capture is skipped while specific
  apps are frontmost. Ships with 1Password 7/8, Bitwarden, Keychain Access,
  Apple Passwords, LastPass, and KeePassXC; user-editable via a file picker
  that reads the bundle ID from the chosen `.app`.
- **nspasteboard.org convention**: apps that mark copies as
  `ConcealedType` / `TransientType` are silently ignored regardless of the
  ignore list.
- Retention sweeps run on launch and hourly.

## Browsing

- fzf-style **fuzzy search** as you type (word-boundary, consecutive-match,
  and camelCase bonuses).
- **Type-keyword search**: `image` matches image entries, `file` matches
  file-reference entries, image dimensions (`400x300` / `400×300`) match
  too, and filename fragments match file entries without needing full paths.
- **⌘1 – ⌘9 quick-paste** the Nth visible entry. ⇧⌘N pastes plain text.
  The first nine rows show their shortcut inline so you don't have to
  memorise the positions.
- **Code-aware row chips**: any entry detected as code gets a small
  language tag next to the source-app name. 17 languages detected via
  regex heuristics: JSON, YAML, XML, HTML, Markdown, Swift, Java,
  JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, SQL, Shell, Dockerfile,
  CSS. Detection order resolves shared-keyword conflicts (Java is
  checked before Python so `class Foo { … }` doesn't falsely match).
- **Pin / unpin** entries so they stay on top (⌘P).
- **Delete** with ⌘⌫.

## ⌘O — Obfuscate (screen-share safety)

Mark sensitive entries — passwords you paste daily — so Birchboard never
renders the payload in any UI surface, while ⏎ still pastes the real value.

- ⌘O on a text or RTF row toggles obfuscation. The first toggle opens an
  inline nickname editor; ⏎ saves, Esc cancels. Empty nickname is allowed —
  the row just shows `🔒 ••••••••`.
- ⌘R re-edits the nickname later.
- The list row, side preview, and Quick Look all show
  `🔒 nickname  ••••••••` instead of the content. Language detection,
  syntax highlighting, transforms (⌘T), snippets-against (⌘S), actions
  (⌘K), and Quick Look (⌘Y) are all suppressed for obfuscated rows so the
  payload is never lexed or rendered.
- **Search hits the nickname only** — typing the underlying text won't
  filter to the row. Hard requirement for screen-shares: typing the
  password into the search field can't reveal it.
- Obfuscated rows are exempt from retention sweeps (treated like pinned).
- Pin and obfuscate are independent flags; you can pin an obfuscated entry
  and the lock + pin icons both appear.
- Toggling obfuscation off restores normal rendering and clears the
  nickname.

## Previews

- Live preview pane adjacent to the list — plain monospaced text, no
  highlighting. Kept lightweight so arrowing through code-heavy history
  doesn't stutter while re-detecting and re-lexing on every selection.
- **⌘Y Quick Look overlay**: full-panel preview of the selected entry,
  with code-aware **syntax highlighting** for any detected language —
  Swift through the Splash highlighter, other languages via a generic
  keyword/string/number/comment rule set. Full-size images, larger
  monospaced text, file paths with icons. Arrow keys still navigate
  entries while the overlay is open.
- **Structured tree view**: Quick Look on a JSON, YAML, or XML entry
  renders the payload as a collapsible tree — keys, typed values (strings,
  numbers, bools, null), array indices, XML elements (`<tag>`), XML
  attributes (`@attr`), and text nodes (`#text`) all coloured
  consistently with the in-line highlighter. Click any `{ … keys }` /
  `[ … items ]` / `<tag>` row to expand or collapse. Each subtree's
  expansion state is independent. Falls back to the flat highlighted
  preview if the payload doesn't parse.

## ⌘T — Transform picker

Replace the clipboard payload with a transformed version before pasting.
Inapplicable transforms (e.g. "Pretty JSON" over non-JSON) are hidden
upfront; fuzzy-filter by name. 27 built-in transforms across the
categories below.

- **JSON** — Pretty-print, minify.
- **JSON ↔ YAML** — auto-direction.
- **JWT** — decode to pretty-printed header + payload.
- **Timestamp** — Unix time ↔ ISO 8601, auto-direction. Accepts 10-digit
  seconds or 13-digit millisecond inputs.
- **Hashes** — SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5.
- **Number bases** — prints dec / hex / bin simultaneously for a decimal,
  `0x`-prefixed, or `0b`-prefixed integer.
- **Query string ↔ JSON** — `foo=1&bar=hello%20world` ↔ flat `{"foo":"1",…}`.
- **Encoding** — Base64 encode/decode, URL encode/decode (RFC 3986
  unreserved set).
- **Case** — UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, camelCase, snake_case,
  kebab-case.
- **Trim whitespace** — three variants:
  - Whole-string leading + trailing.
  - Per-line trailing only (preserves indentation).
  - Per-line leading + trailing (flattens indentation and cleans trailing
    spaces).
  Each variant only appears when it would actually change the payload.
- **Strip** — ANSI escape codes, HTML tags.
- **Extract** — all URLs, all email addresses.

## ⌘S — Snippet picker

User-authored canned text that can be pasted without copying first.
Managed in Settings → Snippets (list with add / edit / delete / reorder,
multi-line body editor).

Placeholders expand at paste time:

- `{clipboard}` — whatever's currently on the clipboard.
- `{date}` / `{date:yyyy-MM-dd}` / any `DateFormatter` template.
- `{time}` / `{time:HH:mm}`.
- `{uuid}` — fresh UUID each expansion.
- `{newline}` / `{tab}` — literal escape shortcuts.
- `{{` / `}}` — literal braces.

Example body: `Thanks for {clipboard} — logged at {date} {time:HH:mm}.`

Unknown tokens pass through unchanged (no silent deletion on typos).

## ⌘K — Type-aware actions

The picker only shows actions that apply to the selected entry's detected
type ("pure match" — the entire trimmed payload must match, not merely
contain a URL/email/etc.).

- **URL** → Open in Browser, Paste as Markdown link.
- **File(s)** → Reveal in Finder, Open.
- **Email** → Compose Mail to…
- **Phone** → Call with FaceTime.
- **Hex color** (`#RRGGBB` / `#RGB` / `#RRGGBBAA`) → Paste as `rgb()`,
  Paste as `hsl()` (handles alpha).

## Preferences (Settings → General)

- **Retention** — cap history by count and age (defaults: 1000 entries,
  90 days). Pinned entries never expire.
- **Panel opacity** — slider, 30–100%.
- **Restore previous clipboard after paste** — optional; using a history
  entry doesn't disturb your current clipboard.
- **Launch at login** — via `SMAppService`.
- **Custom global hotkey** — standard shortcut recorder (default ⌘⇧V).
- **Automatic updates** via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org). Default
  24-hour background check; **Check Now** button and a toggle live in
  Settings → General → Updates. Also exposed as **Check for Updates…** in
  the menu-bar menu. Updates are EdDSA-signed and served from a GitHub
  Pages appcast.

## Privacy & storage (Settings → Privacy)

- Fully local. No cloud, no analytics, no telemetry.
- SQLite database + content-addressed image blobs at
  `~/Library/Application Support/Birchboard/`. Delete that folder to fully
  reset.
- **Clear unpinned** / **Clear all history** buttons.
- **Ignored apps list** — add / remove / reset-to-defaults.
- **Export / Import** — the full history, including image bytes, goes into
  a single JSON file via `NSSavePanel`. Import reads the same shape back;
  duplicates are detected by content hash so re-importing the same file
  is a no-op.

## Permissions

- **Accessibility** — required so Birchboard can post a synthetic ⌘V to the
  previously focused app after you pick an entry. Granted via System
  Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility. If declined, Birchboard
  still collects history; you can ⌘V manually after selecting an entry.
- **Sandboxing** — disabled. A clipboard manager needs to observe the
  pasteboard, post HID events globally, and access arbitrary file URLs, none
  of which play well with the App Sandbox.
